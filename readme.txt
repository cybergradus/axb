1. add to _run_.py the code below
import sys
sys.path.append('E:/scripts_from_Git') #path where the axb module folder is located

2. drag'n'drop _run_.py into Maya

3. Check the functionality of single chain IKFK rig. Note that FK rotations are supposed to be set from Graph Editor instead of viewport while ikBlend value is between 0.0 to 1.0

4. Further improvements and scalability are planned for the nearest future (such as separate IK and FK bone chains for possible convenience if necessary)
